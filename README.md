# MHAR (Matrix/Mentat Hit and Run)
This package constains the fastest polytope sample know to date.
It only works with linear inequality restrictions, it does not accept V-representation.  

A paper with the Asymptotic Complexity and Tests for the MHAR is in:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uumami/mhar_pytorch/master/mhar_draft.pdf

A Jupyter Notebook with examples of how to use it is in (works in Colab):
